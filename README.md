# hello-world
this is just me trying to figure out Git

now I created a new branch off the master branch, and named it "readme-edits"

then i dived into that branch's readme file and now I'm typing this right now...

my advice, don't analogise the term Branch as the branches of a tree, as it doesn't seem to me that either of the concepts go down the same line of thought...if it does, then you have to say that the specific branch, at one point, is either going to be cut down, or it's going to replace the tree as a whole, that is, it'll potentially BECOME the tree...
